    <p>Water is the basis of life and it's actually pretty awesome. With a chemical formula of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen center atom, it's got a bent molecular geometry. Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, which allows the molecule to easily form bonds with itself, and other molecules. This is the principle behind adhesion and cohesion which allows water to travel up the water wick shown here to water plants.</p>

     <p>There's a bunch of other interesting things about water, and Canadians have a special relationship with it. Despite the fact that the majority of Canadians live near our southern border, 60% of water drains towards the Arctic Ocean/Hudson's Bay. Additionally, Canada is responsible for 7% of the world's supply of freshwater, and we take this responsibility somewhat responsibly, agreeing to 94 (as of 2017) international or bi-lateral agreements around the environment</p>
